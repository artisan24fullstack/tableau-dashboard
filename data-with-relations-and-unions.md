# Associate your data with Relations and Unions

- Our data is therefore separated into 2 tables.
- it is necessary to make a link between the corresponding rows in the two tables using the "id_***" column.
  
```
* Sometimes, Tableau will automatically detect which columns allow the tables to be related. 
* But sometimes, this information will have to be entered manually!

* For this, we will relate the 2 tables, 
* then we will specify which column(s) allow the link to be made:

* how to relate 2 tables that contain linked information;

* how to indicate the columns that allow linking the information from the 2 tables
