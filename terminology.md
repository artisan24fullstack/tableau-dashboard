# Terminology

## Measures

- Measures are variables that take numerical values, 
- provided that these values express a quantity 
- and have meaning when arithmetic operations are applied to them.

## Dimensions
- Dimensions are all variables... that are not measures! 
- The values they take are called categories or modalities. 
- These are expressed in literal form 
- (by text of 1 or more words, or a code) 
- or by numerical coding on which arithmetic operations have no meaning.
