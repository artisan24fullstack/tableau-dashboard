# Continuous or discrete variables

- There is also another notion that will distinguish variables into 2 distinct groups. 
- This is the notion of continuity.
- A variable can be either discrete or continuous.
- Here is the definition given in the Tableau documentation:
- In Tableau, continuous variables are represented in green and discrete variables in blue.

# Tableau represents data differently in the view depending 

| Aspect | Continuous Variables | Discrete Variables |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Color field in Tableau | Green | Blue |
| Mathematical Definition | Forming an unbroken whole, without interruption | Individually separate and distinct |
| Typical Visualization | Curves (continuous lines) | Bars |
| Default in Tableau | Measures | Dimensions |
| Nature of Data | Can take many different values | Few different possible values |

- The boundary between a continuous variable and a discrete variable is sometimes thin. 
- But between "many" and "not many", some measurements can be considered both continuous and discrete.
- This choice is correct in most cases. 
- However, if this is not relevant, we have the option to modify it
