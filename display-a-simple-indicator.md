# Display a simple indicator

- Simply drag the "***" measure from the left panel to the small "TEXT" frame in the "Marks" shelf:
- By default, when you place a measure in "Text", Tableau will automatically calculate the sum:

## Tableau has applied an aggregation function. 

- Aggregation functions such as sum, average, minimum, maximum, and count can be applied to measures.

```
Here are other examples of aggregation functions available in Tableau:

* SUM: 
* returns the sum of the values;

* AVG: 
* calculates the average of values;

* MINIMUM: 
* takes multiple values and returns the smallest value;

* MAX: 
* calculates the maximum;

* COUNT: 
* returns the number of input values.
```
- PS : You can change the title of the visualization by double-clicking on the title "Sheet 1",
