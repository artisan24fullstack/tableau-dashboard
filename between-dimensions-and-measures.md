# Distinguish-between-dimensions-and-measures

- Why are the lists of variables in tables separated into 2?
- Indeed, you see a small separation (a horizontal gray line) between the variables:

```
* Separation between variables
* In fact, Tableau differentiates variables into 2 categories: 
* dimensions are the variables that are above the gray line 
* and measures are the variables that are below
```

- PS : Codes and/or identifiers are therefore not measures

## Why differentiate between dimensions and measures?

```
* Because they cannot be represented in the same way on graphs: 
* a quantity is not represented in the same way as a category.
