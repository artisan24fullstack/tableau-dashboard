- As we have seen, at the top of the "Spreadsheet" page, 
- there are 2 shelves called "Rows" and "Columns".

```
* This has nothing to do with the rows and columns of the tables!

* In fact, 
* the "Rows" shelf rather refers to the vertical axis 
* and "Columns" to the horizontal axis

* To display a table, 
* place one dimension in "Rows", 
* another dimension in "Columns", 
* and a measure in the "Text" field.
